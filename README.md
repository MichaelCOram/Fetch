# Fetch
Fetch Web Scraping Exercise

Hello, thank you again for your time to review my code. I used Visual Studio Code to develop, debug, and test my solution. Within the script, I have used
Puppeteer and it's functions to interact and acquire needed information directly from the DOM. 

To run the code, Node.js must be installed as well as the Puppeteer library. Using "npm install puppeteer" in the terminal will install Puppeteer and its
dependencies.
