Fetch Web Scraping Exercise

Hello, thank you for taking the time to review my code. During the process of writing this, I have learned a learned a lot
about javascript and have definitely found where I can improve. My biggest challenge and something I still have not been 
able to grasp within the code is the selectors from the DOM. I believe my logical implementation of what is needed to be 
accomplished from the script is accurate, however, I may not be accessing all neccessary information from the DOM correctly. 
Any constructive critism would be very much appreciated, and thank you so much again for the consideration.
